# Vision-X

Vision X is a PyTorch library that helps you create faster AI models from GANS to ComputerVision with only a small function

The Training it will be made in real time and you can see the performance of the model

You can also get a pretrained model 

Fine tunning will be made easier because we are introducing the concept of adding more layers after a pretrained model creating a perfect fine tunning experience with major improvements in accuracy

Helper functions can be used to visualize informatino about model
